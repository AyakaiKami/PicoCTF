            Hi there! My name is Cristea-Olaru Stefan, and I am a cybersecurity and low-level programming enthusiast.
            <br>
            I usually go by PHM, which stands for the first Nine Inch Nails album, Pretty Hate Machine. I am a student at UAIC studying Computer Science. I began my journey in cybersecurity at the beginning of 2024 when I received a recommendation on YouTube about TryHackMe. I got hooked on pwn style CTFs and tried to learn as much as I could about RedHat Hacking.
            <br>
            I started participating in CTF competitions when one of my friends asked me to join him in one. In that competition, I only solved one challenge, but it was enough for me to start my journey out of the "Script Kitty" position.
            <br>
            I wish to share my journey in cybersecurity, and that's why you're looking at this page.
